# DocstringGen

Remember when you were taught that your code should be self-descriptive? Now you can put it into use! 
This project aims to be a tool that will write code documentation/docstrings for you.

WIP: This project is in *very* early stages and will contain messy code, hard-coded paths and other. Enter at your own risk.
